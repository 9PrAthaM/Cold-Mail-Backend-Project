# Cold-Mail-Backend-Project
Java backend API using Spring boot framework 
In this project, you can cold mail to particular mail. through postman,
request body is like :{
    "emails":["abcd@gmail.com"]
} 
For now, I have only one mail but my future plan is to build for trigger multiple main also we can attach files in this but there is a code change for that .
